# No_Show_Appointment-Dataset_Investigation
Investigating a Dataset (Medical Appointment Attendance)
This dataset (No-show Appointment) collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

ScheduledDay tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
Neighborhood indicates the location of the hospital.
Scholarship indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa FamÃƒÂ­lia.
Be careful about the encoding of the last column: it says Ã¢Â€Â˜NoÃ¢Â€Â™ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and Ã¢Â€Â˜YesÃ¢Â€Â™ if they did not show up.
